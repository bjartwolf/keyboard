keyboard
========

UBUNTU:	
*******
This is for my ubuntu 12.04 setup
It's more or less stolen from http://www.ninthavenue.com.au/vim-key-bindings-in-ubuntu-using-xmodmap, but I keep it for reference and I do slight modifications to it.

Just run xmodmap .bjartwolf.keymap

To change to norwegian keyboard run
sudo setxkbmap no
.xmodmap .bjartwolf.keymap

WINDOWS 7:
**********
Use SharpKeys to map caps lock to application key
Special: Caps Lock(00_3A) To: Special: Application (E0_5D)

Then use AutoHotkey with the script.

Both packages are available from choclatey.org (autohotkey, sharpkeys)
